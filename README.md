# cpp_dev_env

dockerized cpp playground with `clangd` static analysis and sanitizers (address, thread, undefined behavior). Useful as playground for arbitrary c++ / CMake.

demo app is basic multi-target client-server debugging on container host

compose'd multi-target would require extra config / gdbserver handrolls since vscode docker extension supports node/C#/Python only
